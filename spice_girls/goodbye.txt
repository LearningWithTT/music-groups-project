No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Now listen, little child, there will come a day
When you will be able, able to say
Never mind the pain or the aggravation
You know there's a better way for you and me to be
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Fly like an Angel, Heaven sent to me
Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it, time will never change it, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
Just a little girl, big imagination
Never letting no one take it away
Went into the world (into the world)
What a revelation
She found there's a better way, for you and me to be
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain
Love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby
Goodbye, my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it, time will never change it, no, no, no (no, no, no, no)
You know it's time to say goodbye (no, no, no, no)
The times when we would play about
The way we used to scream and shout
We never dreamt you'd go
Your own sweet way
Look for the rainbow in every storm
Find out for certain
Love's gonna be there for you
You'll always be someone's baby
Goodbye my friend
(I know you're gone, you said you're gone, but I can still feel you here)
It's not the end
(You gotta keep it strong before the pain turns into fear)
So glad we made it, time will never, never ever change it (no, no, no, no)
You know it's time to say goodbye (no, no, no, no)
And don't forget you can rely on (no, no, no, no)
You know it's time to say goodbye (no, no, no, no)
And don't forget on me, you can rely on (no, no, no, no)
I will help you, help you on your way (no, no, no, no)
I will be with you every day (no, no, no, no)
I will be with you every day (no, no, no, no)
