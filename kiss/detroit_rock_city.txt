Roll all night and party every day
I wanna rock and roll all night and party every day
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to
everybody's gonna move their feet
(Get down) everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
(Get up) everybody's gonna move their feet
(Get down) everybody's gonna leave their seat
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start up the car, and I try to make the midnight show
everybody's gonna move their feet
(Get down) everybody's gonna leave their seat
Movin' fast, doin' 95
Hit top speed but I'm still movin' much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
I hear my song playin' on the radio
It goes
everybody's gonna move their feet
(Get down) everybody's gonna leave their seat
12 o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights starin' at my eyes
Oh, my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?
everybody's gonna move their feet
everybody's gonna move their feet
