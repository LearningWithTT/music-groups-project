Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't calling me "baby"
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't calling me "baby"
Better say my name
Any other day I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?" But today it ain't the same
Every other word is "Uh-huh", "Yeah, okay"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around and be played
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you saying everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there, then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't calling me "baby"
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't calling me "baby"
Better say my name
What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, say you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago you said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie?
Getting caught up in your game, where you cannot say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you saying everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there, then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't calling me "baby"
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you, say, "Baby, I love you"
If you ain't running game
Say my name, say my name
You acting kind of shady, ain't calling me "baby"
Better say my name
Oh, yeah (where my ladies at?)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, yeah (please say that, come on)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (all the girls say)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah (I can't hear ya)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (all the ladies say)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (all the girls say)
Ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah, ye-yeah (break it down)
Oh, woah, woah (ye-ye-yeah)
(Uh, uh, uh, DC, take it to the bridge, come on)
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down, that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange

Thou shalt know she can't love you
